      <p STYLE="text-align: text-top"> <p>There are people who speak into existence demons,</p><p>conjurers,
dark magic falls from their lips in waterfalls</p><p>cascading
down their tongues like raindrops in April,</p><p>they
breathe caskets like the last breath of a dying wish</p><p>blowing
Grim Reaper-smoke rings, </p><p>their
tongues dressed in spikes,</p><p>their
words bathed in acid</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These
people, their demons</p><p>more
human than hellion,</p><p>level
spirits with the force of earthquakes on cities,</p><p>but break
souls simply like dipped toes do to still waters,</p><p>you
quiver from their touch </p><p>and the
pain they cause ripples through your flesh-</p><p>your
body, your skin, burnt and crumbling </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These people,
with hatred crawling through their veins</p><p>dripping
from their extremities, their orifices </p><p>their
kiss malignant </p><p>their
demons, not fork-tongued </p><p>hominid-lapping
at salty tears spilling over your eyelids</p><p>their
smile crooked as they reminiscence about bruises theyve caused</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These
people, looming over you like skyscrapers in a city of sand, </p><p>if only
you knew they were just as frail,</p><p>that it
is you who gives them their power they abuse to abuse you,</p><p>yes
you, your fear, their demons</p><p>rotting
you from the inside out,</p><p>your
body now husk, your soul now wilted</p><p>these
demons now full to their capacity</p><p>pregnant-</p><p>you,
fetus in their womb, coffin</p><p>these
demons spoke onto your name. </p>
