<h2 STYLE="font-size: 30px; text-align: left">ABOUT Me</h2>

<p>My name is Lance L. Griffin. I was born in Denver, CO. At the oh so awkward age of 14 I relocated to Toccoa, GA. If you had to Google "Toccoa," that is indicative of the sheer elusivity of the town, which is tucked away in the Northeast Georgia area. Now I call Baton Rouge, LA home. You can say I'm all over the place.</p>
<p>I'm a third year student at the University of Georgia, meaning I am (hopefully) on my way out of here! I major in Psychology. I am a gay man, LGBTQA activist, feminist, and I am absolutely in love with the melanin in my skin.</p>
<h3 STYLE="font-size: 30px; text-align: left">ABOUT FLOetix</h3>
<p>Although writing is not my intended career goal, I have a strong affinity for writing. Ever since I learned how to read the English language I have been devouring words and regurgitating them in as many different ways as my mind can produce them. It is amazing to me how powerful words are. I hope that my words move you and make you think. I hope my words are infectious and fluid, yes, I hope my words surge through you like the blood that is circulating through your body. I hope I can make you laugh, and make you cry.</p>
<p>I appreciate any time you invest in my art form! On this site, you will find a collection of three of my favorite pieces that I have written so far. This is like a sip from the holy grail of all things Lance! On here you will also find a few of my favorite pictures I have taken within the last year. This just means they are pictures I have taken that are sporadically themed. I truly hope this gives you an idea of my writing capabilities and also gives you an impression of the person I am. Lastly, you will see some of the ways in which you can get in contact with me via social media. I hope you enjoy  <b>FLO</b>etix!</p>
